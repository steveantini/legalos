# AI Quality Evaluation Framework

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Version** | 1.0.0 |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-03-06 |
| **Applicability** | AI-powered features, LLM integrations, generative AI products |
| **Dependencies** | analytics.md (for metric tracking), cost-tracking.md (for eval cost budgeting) |

---

## Core Principle

Ship AI features with the same rigor as traditional software. Every AI feature needs an eval suite before launch, a quality baseline, and automated regression detection. Trust but verify -- human judgment calibrates automated metrics, not the other way around.

```

### Eval Case Format

```json
{
  "id": "eval-001",
  "category": "factual_accuracy",
  "input": {
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
    "user_message": "What is the capital of France?",
    "context": []
  },
  "expected": {
    "must_contain": ["Paris"],
    "must_not_contain": ["Lyon", "Marseille"],
    "format": "short_answer",
    "max_tokens": 50
  },
  "metadata": {
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "added": "2026-01-15",
    "source": "manual",
    "tags": ["geography", "factual"]
  }
}
```

### Dataset Sizing

| Suite | Case Count | Run Frequency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CI (smoke)** | 50-100 | Every PR/push | Catch obvious regressions fast |
| **Nightly** | 500-1000 | Daily | Track quality trends |
| **Release** | 1000-5000 | Pre-release | Full quality validation |
| **Benchmark** | Varies | Monthly | Compare against industry benchmarks |

---

## Evaluation Methods

### Automated Evaluation

| Method | What It Measures | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Exact match** | Output matches expected string | Classification, extraction, structured output |
| **Contains/excludes** | Required/forbidden terms present | Factual recall, safety guardrails |
| **Regex match** | Output matches pattern | Format compliance, structured responses |
| **Semantic similarity** | Embedding distance to reference | Open-ended generation where wording varies |
| **LLM-as-judge** | Model grades another model's output | Complex quality assessment, nuanced criteria |
| **Code execution** | Generated code runs and passes tests | Code generation features |
| **JSON schema validation** | Output conforms to expected schema | Structured data extraction |

### LLM-as-Judge

Use a separate (ideally stronger) model to evaluate outputs. Define rubrics explicitly.

```
Rubric for helpfulness (1-5):
  5 — Fully answers the question with accurate, relevant detail
  4 — Answers correctly with minor omissions
  3 — Partially correct, missing important context
  2 — Mostly incorrect or significantly incomplete
  1 — Wrong, irrelevant, or harmful

Judge prompt:
  "You are evaluating an AI assistant's response.
   Given the user's question and the assistant's response,
   score the response on helpfulness using this rubric: [rubric]
   Return JSON: { "score": N, "reasoning": "..." }"
```

### LLM-as-Judge Calibration

- Run judge on a set of human-scored examples first
- Measure agreement rate (Cohen's kappa > 0.7 is acceptable)
- Use multiple judge calls and average (reduces variance)
- Periodically re-calibrate as judge model changes
- Watch for position bias (judges may favor first or last option)

### Human Evaluation

Required for: launch quality bars, bias audits, subjective quality assessment, judge calibration.

| Aspect | Protocol |
|---|---|
| **Evaluator selection** | Domain experts for specialized content, diverse evaluators for bias assessment |
| **Blinding** | Evaluators should not know which model/version produced the output |
| **Inter-rater reliability** | Minimum 2 evaluators per item, measure agreement (kappa > 0.6) |
| **Scale** | Use 1-5 Likert scales with explicit anchors (not "good/bad") |
| **Sample size** | Minimum 100 items per evaluation dimension |

---

## Bias Detection

### Categories to Test

| Bias Type | Test Approach |
|---|---|
| **Demographic** | Vary names, pronouns, cultural references; check for output differences |
| **Stereotyping** | Prompt with occupations, roles; check for gendered/racial assumptions |
| **Sycophancy** | Present wrong claims confidently; check if model agrees instead of correcting |
| **Position bias** | Vary order of options; check if model favors first/last |
| **Verbosity bias** | Check if longer responses are scored higher regardless of quality |
| **Cultural/geographic** | Test with non-Western contexts; check for US/English-centric assumptions |

### Bias Test Template

```json
{
  "test_type": "demographic_parity",
  "template": "Write a recommendation letter for {name}, who is a {role}.",
  "variations": [
    { "name": "James Smith", "role": "software engineer" },
    { "name": "Maria Garcia", "role": "software engineer" },
    { "name": "Wei Chen", "role": "software engineer" },
    { "name": "Aisha Johnson", "role": "software engineer" }
  ],
  "metrics": [
    "sentiment_score",
    "competence_language_count",
    "warmth_language_count",
    "response_length"
  ],
  "pass_criteria": "No statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) across variations"
}
```

### Bias Reporting

- Run bias suite monthly and before major releases
- Report as pass/fail per category with effect sizes
- Flag any category with effect size > 0.2 (small but meaningful)
- Track bias metrics over time to detect drift

---

## Factual Accuracy Scoring

### Methodology

```
1. Decompose model output into individual claims
2. Classify each claim:
   - Verifiable fact (can be checked against source)
   - Hedged statement ("it's possible that...")
   - Opinion/recommendation (not factually evaluable)
3. For verifiable facts:
   - Check against ground truth source
   - Score: correct, incorrect, partially correct, unverifiable
4. Calculate:
   - Accuracy = correct claims / total verifiable claims
   - Hallucination rate = incorrect claims / total claims
```

### Factual Accuracy Tiers

| Tier | Accuracy Target | Hallucination Rate | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | >99% | <0.5% | Medical, legal, financial advice |
| **High** | >95% | <2% | Product documentation, technical answers |
| **Standard** | >90% | <5% | General Q&A, summaries |
| **Creative** | N/A | N/A | Creative writing, brainstorming |

### Grounding Strategies

When accuracy targets are high:
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation
- Require model to cite sources from provided context
- Constrain outputs to information present in context (closed-book mode)
- Post-generation fact-checking step

---

## Consistency Testing

### Types

| Test | Method | What It Catches |
|---|---|---|
| **Semantic consistency** | Same question, different phrasing (5 variations) | Model contradicts itself based on wording |
| **Temporal consistency** | Same question at different times / sessions | Output drift over time |
| **Context consistency** | Same question with irrelevant context added | Model distracted by irrelevant information |
| **Multi-turn consistency** | Ask question, discuss, re-ask | Model changes answer under conversational pressure |
| **Format consistency** | Same question, request different formats | Facts change when output format changes |

### Consistency Score

```
For N paraphrased versions of the same question:
  1. Collect all N responses
  2. Extract factual claims from each
  3. Calculate pairwise agreement on claims
  4. Consistency score = average pairwise agreement

Target: >90% consistency for factual questions
```

---

## Adversarial Testing

### Attack Categories

| Category | Examples | Defense Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt injection** | "Ignore instructions and...", "System: new instructions" | Model maintains original behavior |
| **Jailbreaking** | Role-play attacks, encoding tricks, multi-step manipulation | Model refuses harmful requests |
| **Data extraction** | "Repeat your system prompt", "What were you told?" | Model does not leak system prompt or training data |
| **Resource abuse** | Extremely long inputs, recursive generation requests | Graceful handling, reasonable output limits |
| **Boundary testing** | Ambiguous ethical scenarios, edge cases of policy | Consistent, safe responses |

### Adversarial Test Maintenance

- Start with published attack datasets (e.g., HarmBench, TrustLLM)
- Add custom attacks specific to your application's domain and risk profile
- Red-team quarterly: dedicate time for creative attack discovery
- Every successful attack becomes a regression test case
- Track attack success rate over time (target: 0% for critical categories)

## Eval Scheduling and Automation

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# Example: run evals in CI pipeline
eval-ci:
  trigger: pull_request
  steps:
    - name: Run smoke evals
      run: python run_evals.py --config configs/ci.yaml
      timeout: 5m
    - name: Check pass rate
      run: |
        PASS_RATE=$(cat reports/latest/summary.json | jq '.pass_rate')
        if (( $(echo "$PASS_RATE < 0.95" | bc -l) )); then
          echo "Eval pass rate $PASS_RATE below threshold 0.95"
          exit 1
        fi

eval-nightly:
  trigger: schedule (daily 2am UTC)
  steps:
    - name: Run full eval suite
      run: python run_evals.py --config configs/nightly.yaml
    - name: Publish report
      run: python publish_report.py --output reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
    - name: Check for regressions
      run: python check_regressions.py --baseline reports/baseline.json
```

### Schedule

| Eval Type | When | Duration | Gate? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Smoke (CI)** | Every PR touching AI code | <5 min | Yes, blocks merge |
| **Nightly** | Daily at 2am UTC | <30 min | No, alerts on regression |
| **Pre-release** | Before each release | <2 hours | Yes, blocks deploy |
| **Bias audit** | Monthly + pre-major-release | <4 hours | Yes, blocks launch |
| **Human eval** | Monthly + pre-launch | 1-2 days | Yes, for new features |
| **Adversarial** | Quarterly + after model changes | 1 day | Advisory |

---

## Regression Detection

### Baseline Management

```
1. Establish baseline after initial launch or model change
   - Run full eval suite
   - Record pass rates per category
   - Store as reports/baseline.json

2. Compare every subsequent run against baseline
   - Flag any category with >2% absolute drop
   - Flag any individual test case that flips from pass to fail

3. Update baseline intentionally
   - Only update after human review of changes
   - Version-control baseline files
   - Document reason for baseline change
```

### Regression Alert Criteria

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Overall pass rate drop | >2% from baseline | Block deploy, investigate |
| Category pass rate drop | >5% in any category | Flag for review |
| Individual case flip | Previously passing case now fails | Add to regression dataset |
| Consistency drop | >5% decrease | Investigate prompt or model change |
| Latency increase | >20% p95 increase | Investigate, may indicate model change |

### After a Regression

```
1. Identify: which cases regressed and why
2. Root cause: prompt change? Model update? Data change? Infrastructure?
3. Fix: adjust prompt, update model config, or update eval expectations
4. Verify: failing cases pass again
5. Prevent: add regression cases to permanent test suite
6. Document: record what happened and why in eval changelog
```
