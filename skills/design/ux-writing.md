## Error Messages

### Structure: What, Why, What Next

Every error message should answer three questions:

1. **What happened** — Describe the problem clearly.
2. **Why it happened** — Give context if helpful (omit if obvious).
3. **What to do** — Provide a concrete next step.

### Examples

| Bad | Good |
|---|---|
| "Error" | "Could not save your changes. Check your connection and try again." |
| "Invalid input" | "Email address must include an @ symbol." |
| "403 Forbidden" | "You don't have permission to view this page. Contact your admin for access." |
| "Something went wrong" | "We couldn't load your projects. Try refreshing the page." |
| "Request failed" | "Payment could not be processed. Please check your card details." |
| "Null reference error" | "Something unexpected happened. Our team has been notified." |

### Error Message Rules

- **Never show technical details** to users (stack traces, error codes, SQL errors).
- **Never blame the user**: Say "That password is too short" not "You entered a bad password."
- **Be specific**: "File must be under 10 MB" not "File too large."
- **Use plain language**: "Could not connect" not "Network request timed out (ETIMEDOUT)."
- **Provide an action**: Every error should suggest what to do next — retry, change input, contact support.
- **Log the technical details** server-side for debugging; show the human message client-side.

### Error Severity Tiers

| Severity | Presentation | Duration | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Field validation** | Inline text below field | Persistent until fixed | "Password must be at least 8 characters." |
| **Form-level** | Alert banner above or below form | Persistent until fixed | "Please fix the 2 errors below." |
| **Action failure** | Toast notification | 8 seconds or persistent | "Could not delete project. Try again." |
| **Page-level** | Full error state replacing content | Until refresh/retry | "This page could not be loaded." |
| **System-wide** | Top banner across entire app | Until resolved | "We're experiencing issues. Some features may be unavailable." |

### Retry Pattern

```
[Error icon] Could not save changes.
[Try again button]  [Dismiss link]
```

If auto-retrying, tell the user: "Having trouble connecting. Retrying..."

---

## Loading States

### Copy by Duration

| Duration | Message | Example |
|---|---|---|
| < 1 second | No message | Skeleton or spinner only |
| 1-5 seconds | Brief label | "Loading..." |
| 5-15 seconds | Contextual label | "Loading your projects..." |
| 15-60 seconds | Progress + explanation | "Setting up your workspace. This may take a moment." |
| > 60 seconds | Progress + time estimate | "Importing 2,400 records. About 2 minutes remaining." |

### Loading Message Rules

- **Be specific about what is loading**: "Loading dashboard..." not just "Loading..."
- **For long operations, explain why**: "Generating your report from 30 days of data."
- **Show progress when possible**: "Uploading... 3 of 12 files" or a progress bar.
- **Use progressive disclosure**: Show partial content as it loads, not a blank screen.
- **Never say "Please wait"** — it adds nothing. Say what is happening instead.

### Post-Action Feedback

| Action | Feedback |
|---|---|
| Save | "Changes saved" (toast, auto-dismiss) |
| Delete | "Project deleted" (toast with Undo action) |
| Send | "Invitation sent to alex@example.com" |
| Create | "New project created" (redirect to it) |
| Copy | "Copied to clipboard" (tooltip near button, 2s) |

---

## Empty States

### Structure

```
[Illustration or icon]
[Headline — what this section is for]
[Description — why it is empty and what they can do]
[Primary action button]
```

### Examples

**No projects yet**:
```
[Folder icon]
No projects yet
Projects help you organize your work. Create your first one to get started.
[+ Create project]
```

**No search results**:
```
[Search icon]
No results for "quarterly report"
Try adjusting your search or filters.
[Clear filters]
```

**No notifications**:
```
[Bell icon]
You're all caught up
When something needs your attention, it will appear here.
```

**No permission**:
```
[Lock icon]
You don't have access to this workspace
Ask your team admin to invite you.
[Request access]
```

### Empty State Rules

- **Always include an action** when the user can create the thing that is missing.
- **Differentiate first-time empty from filtered empty**: "No projects yet" vs. "No projects match your filters."
- **Keep it brief**: 1 headline + 1 sentence max.
- **Use illustration sparingly**: A simple icon is often enough. Decorative illustrations are optional.
- **Never say "No data found"**: That is a developer message, not a user message.

## Confirmation Dialogs

### When to Confirm

- **Destructive actions**: Delete, remove, revoke access.
- **Irreversible actions**: Send email, publish, finalize.
- **High-impact actions**: Bulk operations, account changes.

### When NOT to Confirm

- **Easily undone actions**: Archive (can unarchive), soft delete.
- **Routine actions**: Save, create, update — use feedback (toast) instead.
- **Navigation**: Do not confirm leaving a page unless there are unsaved changes.

### Confirmation Dialog Structure

```
[Title — action being confirmed]
[Description — consequence of the action]
[Cancel button]  [Confirm button with specific verb]
```

### Examples

**Delete project**:
```
Title:    Delete "Marketing Site"?
Body:     This will permanently delete the project and all its data.
          This action cannot be undone.
Buttons:  [Cancel]  [Delete project] (destructive style)
```

**Remove team member**:
```
Title:    Remove Alex from this workspace?
Body:     Alex will lose access to all projects in this workspace immediately.
Buttons:  [Cancel]  [Remove]
```

### Confirmation Dialog Rules

- **Title = verb + object**: "Delete project?" not "Are you sure?"
- **Never say "Are you sure?"**: It is vague and adds friction without clarity.
- **Confirm button = specific verb**: "Delete project" not "OK" or "Yes."
- **Destructive confirm buttons are red/destructive variant**.
- **Cancel is always safe and default-focused** (accessible via Escape).
- **Include the name** of the thing being affected: "Delete 'Marketing Site'?" not "Delete this project?"
- **State the consequence**: "This will permanently delete all data" or "Alex will lose access immediately."

## Tooltips

### When to Use

- **Icon-only buttons**: Explain what the button does on hover/focus.
- **Truncated text**: Show full text on hover.
- **Supplementary info**: Brief additional context that does not fit in the UI.

### When NOT to Use

- **Essential information**: If users need it, show it in the interface directly.
- **Mobile primary actions**: Tooltips require hover, which does not exist on touch.
- **Long content**: More than 1-2 sentences belongs in a popover or help page.

### Tooltip Content Rules

- **Maximum 1-2 short sentences** (under 150 characters).
- **No titles or headings** inside tooltips.
- **Action tooltips**: Describe the action. "Copy to clipboard" not "Copy button."
- **Info tooltips**: Provide context. "Last updated 3 hours ago" not "Timestamp."
- **Include keyboard shortcut** if available: "Bold (Cmd+B)."

### Examples

| Trigger | Tooltip Text |
|---|---|
| Copy icon button | "Copy to clipboard" |
| Help icon next to field | "Your display name is visible to other members." |
| Truncated project name | Full project name |
| Keyboard shortcut button | "Undo (Ctrl+Z)" |

## Onboarding

### Principles

- **Delay until relevant**: Do not explain features before the user needs them.
- **Show, do not tell**: Interactive steps beat text explanations.
- **Skippable always**: Every onboarding flow must have a "Skip" option.
- **Progressive**: Introduce one concept at a time, not all at once.

### Onboarding Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Welcome screen** | First login | Single modal with 1-3 setup steps |
| **Empty state guidance** | First time in a section | Inline within the empty state |
| **Contextual hints** | First use of a feature | Popover near the UI element |
| **Checklist** | Multi-step setup | Persistent sidebar or card |
| **Interactive tour** | Complex interface | Step-by-step with highlights |

### Welcome Flow Example

```
Step 1: "Welcome to [App]. Let's get you set up."
        [Set up profile picture — optional]
        [Continue]  [Skip for now]

Step 2: "Create your first project"
        [Project name input]
        [Create project]

Step 3: "Invite your team"
        [Email input]
        [Send invites]  [I'll do this later]
```

### Onboarding Copy Rules

- **Headline = benefit or outcome**: "Stay on top of your tasks" not "Task management feature."
- **Keep steps short**: 1 sentence of explanation per step max.
- **Use verbs**: "Create a project" not "Project creation."
- **Celebrate completion**: "You're all set!" not "Setup complete."
- **Make skip guilt-free**: "I'll do this later" not just "Skip."

### Returning Users

- Do not repeat onboarding after completion.
- Store completion state per feature, not globally.
- For new features post-onboarding, use contextual hints (one-time popovers).

## Tone and Voice Guidelines

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Clear** | No jargon, no ambiguity | "3 projects" not "multiple projects" |
| **Concise** | Fewest words needed | "Saved" not "Your changes have been saved successfully" |
| **Helpful** | Guides toward resolution | "Try a shorter name" not "Invalid input" |
| **Confident** | Definitive, not uncertain | "This will delete the project" not "This might delete the project" |
| **Respectful** | Never condescending | "That email is already registered" not "You already signed up" |

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Success | Warm, brief | "Project created." |
| Error | Calm, actionable | "Could not connect. Check your internet and try again." |
| Warning | Direct, informative | "You have unsaved changes." |
| Destructive action | Serious, clear | "This will permanently delete all data. This cannot be undone." |
| Onboarding | Friendly, encouraging | "Welcome! Let's set up your workspace." |
| Empty state | Inviting, helpful | "No tasks yet. Create one to get started." |

### Writing Rules

| Rule | Bad | Good |
|---|---|---|
| Use sentence case for UI | "Create New Project" | "Create new project" |
| No periods on short labels | "Save." | "Save" |
| Periods on full sentences | "Changes saved" | "Your changes have been saved." (if full sentence) |
| Use contractions naturally | "You cannot access" | "You can't access" |
| Avoid "please" in buttons | "Please confirm" | "Confirm" |
| Use "we" sparingly | "We couldn't find..." | "No results found." (or "We couldn't load..." for errors) |
| Numbers: use digits | "three items" | "3 items" |
| Times: be specific | "recently" | "3 minutes ago" |
| Avoid "successfully" | "Successfully created" | "Created" or "Project created" |
| Avoid exclamation marks | "Welcome!" | "Welcome." (or no punctuation) |

### Button Labels

| Action Type | Pattern | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Create | Verb + noun | "Create project", "Add member" |
| Confirm | Specific verb | "Delete project", "Send invite" |
| Navigate | Destination | "Go to settings", "View details" |
| Toggle | Current state | "Mark as complete", "Hide sidebar" |
| Cancel | "Cancel" | Never "No", "Back", or "Nevermind" |

### Placeholder Text

| Field | Placeholder | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Search | "Search projects..." | Include what is being searched |
| Email | "you@example.com" | Show format |
| Name | "Jane Smith" | Show expected format |
| URL | "https://example.com" | Show full format |
| Description | "Describe your project..." | Action-oriented |
| Empty | (leave empty) | If format is obvious from label |
