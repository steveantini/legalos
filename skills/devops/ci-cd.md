## GitHub Actions Workflow Design

### File Structure

```
.github/
  workflows/
    ci.yml              ← Runs on every PR
    deploy-staging.yml  ← Deploys to staging on merge to main
    deploy-prod.yml     ← Deploys to production (manual or tag-triggered)
    scheduled.yml       ← Nightly tasks (dependency audit, cleanup)
  actions/
    setup/action.yml    ← Composite action for shared setup steps
```

### Core Principles

- **One responsibility per workflow**: Separate CI checks from deployment.
- **Fail fast**: Run cheap checks (lint, types) before expensive ones (tests, builds).
- **Cache aggressively**: Dependencies, build artifacts, Docker layers.
- **Pin action versions**: Use SHA, not tags (`actions/checkout@<sha>`).
- **Minimize secrets exposure**: Scope secrets to the jobs that need them.

### Composite Action for Shared Setup

```yaml
# .github/actions/setup/action.yml
name: 'Project Setup'
description: 'Install dependencies with caching'
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
        cache: 'pnpm'
    - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      shell: bash
```

## CI Workflow — PR Checks

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint & Format
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
      - run: pnpm lint
      - run: pnpm format:check

  typecheck:
    name: Type Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
      - run: pnpm typecheck

  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, typecheck]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
      - run: pnpm test --coverage
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: coverage
          path: coverage/

  build:
    name: Build Verification
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, typecheck]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
      - run: pnpm build
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-output
          path: .next/
          retention-days: 1

  security:
    name: Security Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
      - run: pnpm audit --audit-level=high
      - uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
        with:
          extra_args: --only-verified
```

### Job Dependency Graph

```
PR opened
  |
  +-- lint (fast, ~30s)
  +-- typecheck (fast, ~30s)
  +-- security (independent)
  |
  +-- test (needs: lint, typecheck)
  +-- build (needs: lint, typecheck)
```

## Automated Testing on PR

### Test Strategy by Layer

| Layer | Tool | Trigger | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Vitest / Jest | Every PR | Functions, utilities, hooks |
| Component | Testing Library | Every PR | UI components in isolation |
| Integration | Vitest + MSW | Every PR | Feature flows with mocked APIs |
| E2E | Playwright | Pre-deploy / nightly | Critical user paths |

### Test Configuration

```yaml
# E2E on PR (optional, for critical paths only)
e2e:
  name: E2E Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [build]
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
    - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: build-output
        path: .next/
    - run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium
    - run: pnpm e2e
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: failure()
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
```

### Test Optimization

- **Shard large test suites**: `vitest --shard=1/3` across parallel jobs.
- **Run affected tests only**: `vitest --changed HEAD~1` for fast feedback.
- **Playwright**: Run only smoke tests on PR; full suite nightly.
- **Cache Playwright browsers**: Use `actions/cache` with browser version key.

## Linting & Formatting Checks

### Required Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Config File |
|---|---|---|
| ESLint | Code quality, bug prevention | `eslint.config.js` |
| Prettier | Consistent formatting | `.prettierrc` |
| `prettier --check` | Verify formatting without modifying | N/A |

### Enforcement Strategy

- **Pre-commit** (local): `lint-staged` + `husky` for fast feedback.
- **CI** (authoritative): Full lint and format check on every PR.
- **Auto-fix**: Never auto-fix in CI. CI only validates; developers fix locally.

### `package.json` Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix",
    "format:check": "prettier --check .",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

---

## Type Checking

### CI Type Check

```bash
tsc --noEmit --pretty
```

- Runs against the full project, catches cross-file type errors.
- Separate from build — ensures types are valid even if build succeeds with warnings.
- For monorepos: `turbo typecheck` to check all packages in dependency order.

### Strict Mode

Enforce in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true
  }
}
```

## Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

### Approaches

| Method | When | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm audit` | Every PR | Known CVEs in dependencies |
| GitHub Dependabot | Continuous | Auto-PRs for vulnerable deps |
| Snyk / Socket | Continuous | Supply chain analysis |

### Dependabot Configuration

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
      day: monday
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    groups:
      minor-and-patch:
        update-types: [minor, patch]
    reviewers:
      - team-name
```

### Audit in CI

```yaml
- name: Audit Dependencies
  run: pnpm audit --audit-level=high
  continue-on-error: false  # fail the build on high/critical
```

---

## Secrets Scanning

### Prevention

- **Pre-commit hook**: Use `trufflehog` or `gitleaks` locally.
- **CI scan**: Run on every PR against the diff.
- **`.gitignore`**: Always exclude `.env*` (except `.env.example`).

### CI Integration

```yaml
- name: Secrets Scan
  uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
  with:
    base: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
    head: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
    extra_args: --only-verified
```

### If a Secret is Leaked

1. **Rotate immediately** — assume compromised.
2. Revoke the old credential in the provider's dashboard.
3. Remove from git history: `git filter-repo` (rewrite history, force push).
4. Update all environments with new credentials.
5. Audit access logs for unauthorized use.

---

## Build Verification

### What to Verify

- **Build succeeds**: `pnpm build` exits 0.
- **No build warnings treated as errors**: Configure `eslint` and `tsc` to fail on warnings in CI.
- **Bundle size budget**: Fail if bundle exceeds threshold.

### Bundle Size Check

```yaml
- name: Check Bundle Size
  run: |
    pnpm build
    npx @next/bundle-analyzer || true
    # Or use size-limit
    npx size-limit
```

### `size-limit` Configuration

```json
// package.json
{
  "size-limit": [
    { "path": ".next/static/**/*.js", "limit": "300 kB", "gzip": true }
  ]
}
```

---

## Automated Deployment

### Deployment Pipeline

```
PR merged to main
  |
  v
CI checks pass
  |
  v
Deploy to staging (automatic)
  |
  v
Smoke tests pass
  |
  v
Deploy to production (manual approval or automatic)
```

### Staging Deployment Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
name: Deploy Staging

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
      - run: pnpm build
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DATABASE_URL }}
      - name: Deploy
        run: vercel deploy --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
        env:
          VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
```

### Production Deployment Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml
name: Deploy Production

on:
  workflow_dispatch:       # manual trigger
  release:
    types: [published]     # or on release

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://example.com
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
      - run: pnpm build
      - name: Deploy
        run: vercel deploy --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

---

## Staging Promotion

### Promotion Strategy

| Approach | When to Use |
|---|---|
| Git-flow (merge to prod branch) | When staging/prod have different branches |
| Vercel promote | When staging deployment artifact is verified |
| Tag-based (`v1.2.3`) | When releases are versioned |
| Manual approval | When human review required before prod |

### GitHub Environment Protection

```yaml
# In repo Settings > Environments > production:
# - Required reviewers: 1+
# - Wait timer: optional
# - Deployment branches: main only
```

---

## Smoke Testing

### Post-Deploy Smoke Tests

```yaml
smoke-test:
  name: Smoke Test
  needs: [deploy]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: ./.github/actions/setup
    - name: Health Check
      run: |
        for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
          STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$DEPLOY_URL/api/health")
          if [ "$STATUS" = "200" ]; then exit 0; fi
          sleep 5
        done
        exit 1
      env:
        DEPLOY_URL: ${{ needs.deploy.outputs.url }}
    - name: Critical Path Tests
      run: pnpm playwright test --project=smoke
      env:
        BASE_URL: ${{ needs.deploy.outputs.url }}
```

### What to Smoke Test

- **Health endpoint**: `/api/health` returns 200.
- **Homepage loads**: Returns 200, contains expected content.
- **Auth flow**: Login page renders, OAuth redirects work.
- **Critical API**: One key API endpoint responds correctly.
- **Database connectivity**: Health check verifies DB connection.

## Workflow Optimization

### Caching

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.pnpm-store
      .next/cache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-${{ hashFiles('pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-
```

### Concurrency Control

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: deploy-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true   # cancel previous deploys on same branch
```

### Matrix Builds (Multi-Platform)

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [18, 20]
    os: [ubuntu-latest]
  fail-fast: true
```

---

## Notification & Monitoring

### Slack Notification on Failure

```yaml
- name: Notify Failure
  if: failure()
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v2
  with:
    webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
    payload: |
      {"text": "CI failed on ${{ github.ref }} by ${{ github.actor }}"}
```

### Status Badges

```markdown
