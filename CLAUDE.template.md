# [PROJECT NAME] — CLAUDE.md

<!--
  TEMPLATE: Copy this file into your project root and fill in the sections below.
  Remove these HTML comments once customized.

## Project Overview

<!-- One paragraph: what is this product/project? What problem does it solve? -->

### Current Phase

<!-- What phase of development is the project in? What are the immediate priorities? -->

---

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Deployment |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | <!-- e.g., Next.js (TypeScript) --> | <!-- e.g., Vercel --> |
| Backend | <!-- e.g., Python (FastAPI) --> | <!-- e.g., Railway --> |
| Database | <!-- e.g., Supabase (PostgreSQL) --> | <!-- e.g., Supabase Cloud --> |
| AI/ML | <!-- e.g., Claude (Anthropic API) --> | <!-- e.g., Via backend --> |
| Auth | <!-- e.g., Supabase Auth --> | <!-- --> |

### Directory Structure

<!--
  Document the project's directory layout with brief annotations.
  Example:
  ```
  project/
  ├── src/          # Frontend source
  ├── backend/      # API server
  └── docs/         # Documentation
  ```
-->

### Data Flow

<!--
  Describe the primary data flow through the system.
  Example: User Input → Frontend → Backend API → AI/Database → Response → Frontend
  Note any critical constraints (e.g., "frontend never calls external APIs directly").
-->

---

## Coding Conventions

### [Primary Language] (Frontend)

<!--
  Cover: naming conventions, file organization, import ordering,
  server vs. client component rules (if applicable), error handling patterns.
-->

### [Secondary Language] (Backend)

<!--
  Cover: naming conventions, type hints/annotations, async patterns,
  data validation approach, error handling.
-->

### Git

- **Commit format:** `type: description`
- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `security`
- **Branch naming:** `feature/description`, `fix/description`, `chore/description`

---

## Environment & Configuration

<!--
  Cover: environment variable naming convention, secrets management approach,
  development setup instructions, environment separation strategy.
-->

- **Environment variables:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` with appropriate prefixes
- **Secrets:** Never hardcoded, never committed. `.env.local` for dev, hosting provider for prod
- **Environments:** Separate credentials for dev / staging / production

---

## Testing

<!--
  Cover: test file locations, what must be tested, what can be tested lightly,
  naming conventions.
-->

---

## Security Non-Negotiables

<!--
  List hard security requirements that apply to every change.
  Examples:
  - Input sanitization on every endpoint
  - API keys never in frontend code or git
  - Rate limiting on all API endpoints
  - CORS locked to known origins
-->

---

## AI Integration Rules

<!--
  If the project uses AI/LLM APIs, document:
  - Where API calls are made (backend only?)
  - Prompt template management
  - Output validation requirements
  - Cost tracking approach
  - Rate limiting strategy
-->

---

## What Not to Do

<!--
  List explicit anti-patterns and things to never do in this project.
  Be specific — these prevent the most common mistakes.
-->

---

## End-of-Phase Documentation Requirements

At the end of every phase or sub-phase (e.g., Phase 2A, Phase 2B, etc.), before the final commit, you **MUST** update the following files to reflect all changes made during that phase:

- **README.md** — Setup instructions, routes, project structure if changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — New conventions, components, architecture changes
- **CHANGELOG.md** — What was built, what was fixed, date
- **Decision log** — Any new architectural decisions (project-specific file name)
- **.env.example** — Any new environment variables

**This is not optional.** No phase is complete until documentation is current. The final commit of every phase should include documentation updates.

---

## Skill Routing Rules — Mandatory

<!--
  CUSTOMIZE: Update the task-to-skill mappings below based on which skill files
  exist in your project's .claude/skills/ directory. Remove rows for skills you
  don't use and add rows for any project-specific skills.
-->

Before performing any of the following types of work, you MUST read the specified skill file(s) in `.claude/skills/` and follow their conventions. Do not rely on memory from previous sessions — re-read the skill file every time.

| Task Type | Read First | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Any frontend work | `nextjs-frontend.md` | Components, pages, layouts, styling, Tailwind |
| Any backend work | `python-backend.md` | API endpoints, middleware, data models |
| Any database work | `supabase.md` | Schema changes, migrations, queries, RLS policies |
| Any AI/prompt work | `anthropic-api.md` + `prompt-engineering.md` | System prompts, Claude API calls, structured output |
| Any security-related work | `security.md` | Auth, rate limiting, input validation, CORS, secrets |
| Any deployment work | `vercel-deployment.md` | Build config, environment variables, preview deploys |
| Any analytics or logging work | `product-ops.md` | Metrics, tracing, cost tracking, dashboards |
| Any work touching multiple domains | Read ALL relevant skills | Full-stack features, new phases |

If you are unsure whether a skill applies, read it anyway. It is always better to over-consult than to miss a convention.

If a task requires a skill that does not exist in `.claude/skills/` yet but exists in `~/projects/claude-templates/skills/`, copy it into the project first, then read it.

---

## Skill Template Sync Convention

At the end of every phase or sub-phase, after completing the standard documentation updates above, you **MUST** also sync any new patterns, lessons, or gotchas discovered during that phase to the portable skill templates at `~/projects/claude-templates/skills/`.

### Sync Process

1. **Review** every project-specific skill file in `.claude/skills/` that was referenced or updated during this phase
2. **Extract the generalized principle** — strip out project-specific details (project names, specific API keys, specific database tables, specific design tokens) and keep the universal best practice
3. **Update** the corresponding portable template skill file with the generalized version
4. **Create new templates** — if a new skill file was created for this project that doesn't have a portable template equivalent yet, create one in the appropriate subdirectory of `~/projects/claude-templates/skills/`
5. **Version bump** — add a version bump and "Last updated" date to any modified template skill files

### Example

If during a phase you discover that a database's row-level security has an edge case where service role keys bypass policies on joined tables, the project skill gets the specific fix. The portable template gets: "When using admin/service role keys that bypass row-level security, verify behavior on queries involving joins — RLS policies may not propagate across joined tables as expected."

**This is not optional.** No phase is complete until both project-specific skills AND portable templates are current.
