## Skill Catalog

### AI Integration

**`anthropic-api.md`** — Comprehensive Claude API reference covering model selection, message construction, tool use, streaming, extended thinking, and structured output. Includes token counting, cost estimation formulas, rate limit handling, and the Batches API for bulk processing.

**`ui-patterns.md`** — UI component architecture following a five-layer system: tokens, primitives, components, compositions, and templates. Covers design tokens as CSS variables, component API conventions, data tables, forms, modals, toasts, loading states, dark mode, animation, icons, and typography scale.

**`ux-writing.md`** — UX microcopy guidelines for error messages (what happened, why, what to do next), loading and empty states, confirmation dialogs, tooltips, onboarding flows, tone and voice consistency, action-oriented button labels, and effective placeholder text.

### DevOps

**`ci-cd.md`** — GitHub Actions CI/CD design covering workflow structure, composite actions, PR checks (lint, typecheck, test, build, security scan), test strategy by layer, dependency and secrets scanning, build verification, automated deployment pipelines, staging promotion gates, and workflow optimization.

**`environment-management.md`** — Multi-environment strategy across local, preview, staging, and production. Covers configuration hierarchy, environment variable management with Zod validation, database migration promotion, feature flag patterns, rollback procedures, and data seeding for non-production environments.

**`vercel-deployment.md`** — Vercel deployment reference including vercel.json configuration, environment variable scoping by deployment context, preview deployments, custom domain setup, edge functions and middleware, build optimization, caching strategy, monorepo support, GitHub integration, rollback, and CLI usage.

### Frontend

**`nextjs.md`** — Next.js App Router patterns covering file conventions, route organization, server vs. client component decision framework, data fetching strategies, server actions, route handlers, middleware, image and font optimization, metadata and SEO, environment variable exposure rules, and caching behavior summary.

**`react-patterns.md`** — React component patterns including server vs. client component boundaries, state management with useState, useReducer, and Context, custom hook extraction, error boundaries, Suspense for async UI, composition over inheritance, prop drilling avoidance, and performance optimization with memo, useMemo, useCallback, and useTransition.

**`tailwind.md`** — Tailwind CSS conventions covering utility class ordering, mobile-first responsive breakpoints, dark mode implementation, custom theme extension, component-level class organization using cva (class variance authority), the cn() merge utility, animation patterns, common anti-patterns to avoid, and differences between Tailwind v3 and v4.

**`web-accessibility.md`** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance guide covering semantic HTML, ARIA roles and patterns, keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader support, color contrast requirements, accessible form design, skip navigation links, live regions for dynamic content, and a testing checklist.

### Product Ops

**`analytics.md`** — Privacy-preserving analytics design covering event taxonomy, PII handling rules, self-hosted tool options (Plausible, PostHog, Umami), server-side event tracking, funnel and cohort analysis, A/B testing infrastructure, and dashboard design principles.

**`cost-tracking.md`** — AI and infrastructure cost management including per-request cost calculation, cost attribution by user, feature, model, plan, and endpoint, budget alert thresholds, optimization strategies (semantic caching, prompt compression, model routing), infrastructure cost monitoring, and unit economics tracking.

**`observability.md`** — System observability across the three pillars: structured JSON logging, distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry, and metrics collection. Covers error tracking with Sentry, performance monitoring using RED and USE methods with percentile-based alerting, uptime monitoring, and log retention policies.

### Security

**`api-security.md`** — API security patterns for JWT validation, API key management (generation, hashing, scoping, rotation), OAuth2 flows with Authorization Code + PKCE, CORS configuration, rate limiting, request size limits and timeouts, API versioning security considerations, and webhook signature verification.

**`backend-security.md`** — Backend security covering authentication and authorization middleware, password hashing with Argon2id and bcrypt, session management, rate limiting by endpoint type, request validation with Zod, SQL injection prevention, file upload security, HTTP security headers, and sensitive data logging rules.

## How to Use

### Project Configuration

1. Copy `CLAUDE.template.md` into your new project root as `CLAUDE.md`
2. Fill in the blanks — each section has inline comments explaining what to provide
3. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically at session start

### Skills

1. Browse the skill catalog above to find relevant skills for your project
2. Copy the skill files you need into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory
3. Customize any project-specific details (the templates are intentionally generic)

### Skill Template Sync Convention

These templates are living documents. At the end of every phase of every project:

1. **Review** project-specific skill files that were referenced or updated
2. **Extract** generalized lessons — strip project-specific details, keep the universal best practice
3. **Update** the corresponding portable template in this repo
4. **Create** new templates when a project produces a skill with no existing counterpart
5. **Version bump** — update the version and "Last updated" date on any modified skill file
